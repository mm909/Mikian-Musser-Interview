        <p> My name is Mikian Musser and I am more than a resume. I love working with code, I enjoy working with kids, and I couldn’t imagine doing anything else.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="CLp1">
        <p>	I chose to study CS because I wanted to make video games. I wanted to construct worlds with rich atmospheres, compelling characters, and meaningful storylines. It was all about taking my ideas out of the notebook and expressing them on screen.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="CLp1">
        <p>While videogames were the inspiration, the coding experience is what kept me in this field. I love the process of breaking down a problem, writing the functions, testing, and debugging. I love the late nights that turn into early mornings. I love collaborating with my peers and the friendly competition that comes with it. I enjoy the academic process of writing notes, completing assignments, and taking exams. Lately my interests have taken me away from game design and into neural networks and artificial intelligence.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="CLp1">
        <p>	Five years ago, I started volunteering with Sunshine Nevada who hosts summer camps for kids with disabilities. At camp Mend-A-Heart I met kids who were very sick but always had bright smiles and loud laughs. It was here that I found a passion for working with kids. There isn’t a better feeling in the world than having a kid look up to you and want to follow your example. I enjoy having kids in the classroom because I have the opportunity to teach them and be a positive role model in their life. I love challenging myself to present information simple enough for kids to learn. I am reminded of the famous Google interview question, “Explain a database in three sentences to your eight-year-old nephew.”

      <div class="CLp1">
        <p>	I couldn’t imagine doing anything else. Almost inexplicably, there is something about working with kids that just makes me so happy - so grateful. While working for iD Tech I would stay up late working on lesson plans and creating example projects. I would come in early to clean up the classroom and markup the whiteboard. Despite the long and sometimes unpaid hours, I was smiling Monday morning through Friday afternoon. I was excited to come to work everyday. Coding is my passion, teaching is my purpose. Thank you for your consideration. </p>

          <h1>Teaching — iD Tech, Rice University </h1>
          <p>I taught visual programming, Lego Mindstorms, and Scratch to classes of eight kids ages seven to ten years old. I created lesson plans, homework assignments, and coding challenges for kids with variable math and coding skill levels. I balanced teaching the class and working with each student one on one to ensure each student was learning and felt included.</p>

          <p>For the last five years I have volunteered as a counselor for Sunshine Nevada who hosts several summer camps for kids with disabilities. Camp TLC and IAM are for kids on the autism spectrum and camp Mend-A-Heart is for kids with congenital heart defects. Each camp I work with two to four kids and lead them through typical summer camp activities. I have ample experience working with kids on the autism spectrum and feel comfortable working with them in a classroom setting. </p>
